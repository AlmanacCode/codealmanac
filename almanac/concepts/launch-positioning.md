# Launch Positioning

CodeAlmanac is a local, repo-owned wiki maintained by coding agents. Its durable
source is ordinary Markdown under `almanac/`; a local index supports agent and
human reads through commands such as `codealmanac search`, `show`, and `serve`
[@repo-readme].

The useful contrast is not generic “better documentation.” CodeAlmanac preserves
decisions, invariants, gotchas, flows, and operating knowledge that future agent
sessions would otherwise rediscover. Git keeps that knowledge reviewable, while
build, ingest, garden, and sync keep it current [@repo-readme].

Team-chat tools such as TagIt and agentchattr route work and conversation among
agents [@tagit] [@agentchattr]. They are adjacent rather than equivalent:
CodeAlmanac's primary artifact is the maintained repository wiki that later
agents query before changing code.

For a demo, show one non-obvious wiki fact and then retrieve it through the CLI.
