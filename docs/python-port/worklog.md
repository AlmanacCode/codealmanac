# Python Port Worklog

## 2026-06-29

- Active goal created for a full Python rewrite using
  `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md`, Cosmic Python guidance, slow
  development, frequent review, tests, live CLI checks, and small verified
  commits.
- Current branch is `codex/python-port-archive-existing-code`.
- Existing TypeScript/Node implementation is staged under `archive/code/`.
- Local Cosmic Python reference exists as Markdown-only files under
  `docs/reference/cosmic-python/`.
- Read `MANUAL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.almanac/README.md`,
  `docs/python-port-live-agreement.md`, and the CodeAlmanac Cosmic Python
  guide.
- First implementation pressure is the Python spine: packaging, CLI entrypoint,
  application composition root, workspace service, and a test harness.
- Committed archive/docs baseline as `4520812`.
- Added the first Python scaffold: `pyproject.toml`, `src/codealmanac/`,
  `tests/`, `codealmanac` console script, `create_app(...)`, workspace registry
  service, wiki scaffold service, and build workflow-backed `init`.
- Verified first scaffold with `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`,
  `uv run codealmanac --help`, and an isolated live `codealmanac init` plus
  `codealmanac list` smoke run.
- Committed the first Python scaffold as `a803f63`.
- Review pass tightened the workspace registry write path: temp files now use
  unique same-directory names, duplicate workspace names compare
  case-insensitively, and selector helpers have explicit registry-entry types.
- Re-verified the review fix with `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, and
  an isolated live `codealmanac init` plus `codealmanac list` smoke run.
- Sent a Relayforge Discord checkpoint through Doppler-injected
  `almanac/dev` credentials describing the Cosmic Python patterns applied so
  far: composition root, thin CLI adapter, repository/store boundary, and
  deferred Unit of Work machinery.
- Added slice-2 read-model plan in `docs/python-port/slice-2-read-model.md`.
- Added SQLite read-model services: `index` owns SQLite schema and query store,
  `search` and `pages` own user-facing read verbs, and CLI renders service
  results without knowing SQL exists.
- Added `python-frontmatter` after checking for a known frontmatter parsing
  library; Pydantic validates parsed metadata and `StrEnum` names wikilink
  kinds.
- Dogfood found a stale-schema bug against this repo's existing `.almanac/index.db`.
  The Python schema now uses a high version so old Node-era DBs rebuild cleanly.
- Verified slice-2 work with `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, an isolated
  live `search`/`show`/`--mentions`/backlink smoke, and dogfood
  `codealmanac search python --limit 5` against this repo.
- Slice-2 review fixed two correctness issues: `show --body` now wins over
  metadata/field flags, and full index rebuild clears stale topic rows.
  Re-verified with 14 passing tests, ruff, isolated live `show --body --meta`,
  and dogfood search in this repo.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 3 on abstractions before slice 3 and sent a
  Relayforge Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: keep interrogation,
  decision, and mutation separate. Slice 3 therefore adds read-only
  `topics`/`health`; tag/frontmatter mutation stays out of scope.
- Added slice-3 read-only topics and health: `topics`, `topics show`,
  `topics show --descendants`, `health`, and `health --json`.
- Verified slice 3 with 17 passing tests, ruff, isolated live topics/health,
  and dogfood `codealmanac topics` plus `codealmanac health` in this repo.
  Dogfood health currently reports dead refs to archived TypeScript paths,
  which is expected product signal after the Python rewrite archive move.
- Slice-3 review fixed path safety and resilience: file refs now stay
  repo-relative (`/x` becomes `x`, `../x` is ignored), and malformed
  `topics.yaml` no longer breaks read commands. Re-verified with 19 tests,
  ruff, live `health --json`, and dogfood health.
- Added slice-4 `tag`/`untag` frontmatter mutation using `ruamel.yaml` for
  round-trip YAML editing. Verified body preservation, comment preservation,
  CRLF preservation, idempotence, no-frontmatter pages, CLI smoke, 24 tests,
  and ruff.
- Slice-4 review fixed frontmatter closing fences at EOF and no-op untag
  summaries. Re-verified with 25 tests, ruff, and a live EOF/no-op smoke.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 5 on service-layer tests and sent a Relayforge
  Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: behavior tests should mostly drive
  service-layer request models, with lower-level tests reserved for fragile
  implementation boundaries such as YAML round-tripping.
- Added slice-5 topic metadata mutation: `topics create`, `topics describe`,
  `topics link`, and `topics unlink`. The service owns parent existence,
  ad-hoc topic promotion, cycle rejection, and result enums; the wiki helper
  owns round-trip `.almanac/topics.yaml` mutation with `ruamel.yaml`.
- Verified slice 5 with 32 passing tests, ruff, `git diff --check`, isolated
  live topic create/describe/link/unlink/show, CLI help, and dogfood
  `codealmanac topics show cli --descendants` in this repo.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 6 on Unit of Work and sent a Relayforge Discord
  checkpoint. The applied lesson: topic rewrite operations need an explicit
  operation boundary. Because filesystem writes cannot roll back like a
  database transaction, slice 6 builds a full page-rewrite plan before any
  write, writes `topics.yaml` first, then writes affected pages.
- Added slice-6 topic rewrite mutation: `topics rename` and `topics delete`.
  Rename refuses implicit merge into an existing topic; delete removes topic
  edges and page tags without deleting pages or child topics.
- Verified slice 6 with 39 passing tests, ruff, `git diff --check`, isolated
  live topic rename/delete/show, CLI help, and dogfood
  `codealmanac topics show cli --descendants` in this repo.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 12 on CQRS and sent a Relayforge Discord
  checkpoint. The applied lesson: committed markdown is the write-side truth,
  `.almanac/index.db` is a derived read model, and `reindex` is an explicit
  command that mutates only that projection.
- Added slice-7 local maintenance commands: `build` and `reindex`. `build`
  refreshes deterministic wiki scaffold files, registers the workspace, and
  rebuilds the SQLite projection. `reindex` forces a full projection rebuild
  and supports JSON output.
- Verified slice 7 with 42 passing tests, ruff, `git diff --check`, isolated
  live build/reindex/search/help, and top-level `codealmanac --help` in this
  repo.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 13 on dependency injection and sent a Relayforge
  Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: keep dependencies explicit and wired
  in `app.py`; do not hide diagnostics probes in CLI code or add a DI framework.
- Added slice-8 `doctor`: a local diagnostics service and CLI command with text
  and JSON output. The Python v1 doctor checks package/runtime basics, registry
  path, current or named wiki resolution, index summary, and health problem
  count. It deliberately omits archived Node/npm/provider/hosted checks.
- Verified slice 8 with 46 passing tests, ruff, `git diff --check`, dogfood
  `doctor` text/JSON in this repo, and isolated live no-wiki plus built-wiki
  doctor checks.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 4 on service layers and sent a Relayforge Discord
  checkpoint. The applied lesson: `serve` is an HTTP entrypoint over a viewer
  service, not a second parser, SQLite client, or CLI shell-out.
- Added slice-9 local `serve`: FastAPI server adapter, Uvicorn CLI runtime,
  `ViewerService`, explicit Pydantic viewer DTOs, markdown-it-py rendering with
  HTML disabled, and bundled static assets.
- Verified slice 9 with 53 passing tests, ruff, `git diff --check`, live
  `codealmanac serve --port 49217`, API dogfood for overview/search/page,
  CLI help, serve help, and `uv build` wheel inspection confirming viewer
  assets are packaged. Browser-harness could not attach because Chrome requires
  the manual remote-debugging permission click.
- Slice-9 review fixed index freshness semantics exposed by `serve`.
  `ensure_fresh` now computes a source signature and skips SQLite projection
  writes when page fingerprints and `topics.yaml` are unchanged; `reindex`
  remains the explicit forced rebuild. Re-verified with 55 passing tests, ruff,
  live `codealmanac serve --port 49219`, API dogfood for overview/search/page,
  and a SQLite trigger proving warm read traffic did not rewrite `pages`.
- Read Cosmic Python chapters 6, 8, and 10 before the first lifecycle seam and
  sent a Relayforge Discord checkpoint for the Commands vs Events pattern. The
  applied lesson: future lifecycle starts are commands that fail loudly, while
  run-log entries are past-tense facts recorded by the `runs` service.
- Added slice-10 runs ledger and `jobs` read surface: `RunsService`, JSON/JSONL
  run storage under `.almanac/jobs/`, typed run records/events/status enums,
  and `codealmanac jobs`, `jobs show`, and `jobs logs`.
- Verified slice 10 with focused runs/CLI tests, 59 passing full tests, ruff,
  `git diff --check`, and an isolated live dogfood run that created a run
  through `RunsService` and read it back through `codealmanac jobs`, `jobs show`,
  `jobs logs`, and `jobs --json`.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 11 on external events before the source-input
  slice and sent a Relayforge Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: raw
  outside-world inputs should be translated at the boundary into typed messages
  before workflows or agents see them.
- Added slice-11 source input contracts: `SourcesService`, `SourceAddress`,
  `SourceRef`, `SourceBrief`, source kind/provenance enums, local path
  observations and fingerprints, GitHub PR/issue refs and URLs, generic web
  URLs, git range/diff refs, and transcript refs. URL decomposition uses
  `urlsplit`, while validity uses Pydantic `AnyHttpUrl`.
- Verified slice 11 with focused source tests, 64 passing full tests, ruff,
  `git diff --check`, and a live service dogfood run that resolved a mixed
  source input tuple into typed source briefs.
- Read Cosmic Python chapters 4 and 13 before the harness seam and sent a
  Relayforge Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: use cases belong behind
  services/workflows, while `app.py` wires dependencies.
- Added slice-12 harness contracts: `HarnessKind`, `HarnessRunStatus`,
  `HarnessReadiness`, `HarnessRunResult`, `RunHarnessRequest`,
  `HarnessAdapter`, and `HarnessesService`.
- Verified slice 12 with focused harness tests, 68 passing full tests, ruff,
  `git diff --check`, and a live fake-adapter dogfood run through
  `HarnessesService.check()` and `HarnessesService.run(...)`.
- Read Cosmic Python chapters 8 and 10 before wiring `ingest`. The applied
  lesson: `RunIngestRequest` is a command that fails loudly, while run ledger
  entries are events that record facts.
- Added slice-13 internal ingest workflow. It starts a run, resolves sources,
  renders a Pydantic JSON prompt payload, calls the harness service, validates
  changed files under `.almanac/`, refreshes the index, and marks the run done
  or failed.
- Refactored the app composition surface to `app.workflows.build` and
  `app.workflows.ingest`, matching the live agreement.
- Verified slice 13 with focused ingest/harness tests, 73 passing full tests,
  ruff, `git diff --check`, and an isolated fake-harness dogfood run that wrote
  a wiki page, refreshed the index, and read back search plus run-log state.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 3 before the first concrete harness adapter and
  sent a Relayforge Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: workflows depend on
  the `HarnessAdapter` abstraction while Claude subprocess details stay in
  `integrations/harnesses/claude`.
- Added slice-14 Claude CLI adapter. It uses `claude auth status` for readiness,
  `claude -p --output-format json` for runs, Pydantic models for external JSON,
  and git porcelain status snapshots to report changed files.
- Added an architecture test that prevents `cli/`, `workflows/`, and
  `services/` from importing concrete integrations.
- Dogfooded real Claude ingest in a temp Git repo. Claude wrote one
  `.almanac/pages` page, ingest finished successfully, the index refreshed to
  two pages, and search found the new page. The run exposed a naming prompt bug
  (`almanac CLI`), so the ingest prompt now states the public CLI name is
  `codealmanac`, never `almanac` or `alm`.
- Read Cosmic Python chapter 6 before hardening ingest mutation safety and sent
  a Relayforge Discord checkpoint. The applied lesson: a lifecycle write needs
  a stable operation snapshot, but filesystem writes cannot honestly roll back
  like database transactions.
- Added slice-15 ingest mutation safety. `WorkspaceChangeProbe` is a
  workspace-owned port, `GitWorkspaceChangeProbe` parses `git status
  --porcelain=v1 -z --untracked-files=all`, and `IngestMutationPolicy` requires
  Git change tracking, clean `.almanac/` preflight, and no non-wiki mutations
  during the harness run.
- Verified the slice-15 focused behavior with parser, ingest workflow, and
  architecture tests. The workflow allows pre-existing dirty app files when
  unchanged, rejects harness mutation to dirty app files, rejects dirty
  `.almanac/` preflight, and rejects non-Git lifecycle writes.
- Dogfooded slice-15 in a temp Git repo with a dirty `src/app.py` and a fake
  harness writing `.almanac/pages/safety-dogfood.md`. The run finished `done`,
  `result.safety.changed_files` contained only the wiki page, `src/app.py`
  preserved the user's dirty edit, and search found `safety-dogfood`.
- Read Cosmic Python chapters 4 and 10 before exposing public ingest. No new
  pattern checkpoint was sent because the applied command-vs-event and thin
  service-layer lessons were already recorded in earlier slices.
- Added slice-16 public `codealmanac ingest`. The CLI adapts argv into
  `RunIngestRequest`, defaults `--using` to `claude`, accepts `--using codex`
  as the existing harness enum for future adapter parity, and renders a short
  run/source/wiki-change summary.
- Real CLI dogfood exposed two issues before the final success: Claude prompt
  input had to move from a positional argument to stdin because `--tools` is
  variadic, and workflow errors needed to include harness output text. Both are
  fixed and covered by focused tests.
- Dogfooded real `codealmanac ingest note.md --using claude` in a temp Git repo
  after backing up and restoring the local registry. Claude created
  `.almanac/pages/ingest-cli-thin-adapter.md`, search found
  `ingest-cli-thin-adapter`, and Git status showed only that wiki page changed.

## Current Hypothesis

The read and organization paths now cover the main local wiki management loop:
search/show, topic reads, health, tag/untag, topic DAG mutation including
rename/delete, explicit `build`, `reindex`, `doctor`, and a first read-only
local `serve` viewer. The highest-risk serve/index review issue found so far is
fixed: read traffic no longer forces projection rewrites when the source wiki
is unchanged. The first lifecycle/runs spine now exists as a ledger and read
surface. Source inputs and harness execution now have typed service contracts,
the first internal ingest workflow coordinates them with the run ledger and
index, the Claude CLI adapter is wired through the app composition root, and
ingest has provider-neutral Git mutation safety around harness execution. The
public `codealmanac ingest` command now reaches that workflow without making
the CLI an internal API.

## Next Hypothesis

The next slice should either add Codex as the second harness adapter or add the
next lifecycle workflow (`garden` or `sync`) behind the same run/safety seams.
The remaining serve risks are markdown wikilink rewriting inside code spans,
browser-harness verification once Chrome allows remote debugging, and whether a
source/file route belongs in the first viewer shape.
