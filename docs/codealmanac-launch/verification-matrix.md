# Verification Matrix

Status: active.

## Auth / API

Must prove:

- WorkOS/AuthKit is the cloud identity provider.
- `codealmanac login` opens browser/device auth, stores local auth under
  `~/.codealmanac/`, and `codealmanac whoami` succeeds from a fresh shell.
- Public API routes verify WorkOS-backed credentials.
- Auth, capture, run-start, and wiki-read endpoints return `429` with
  `Retry-After` under configured abuse tests.
- Capture hooks use a narrow capture credential, not an unrestricted human
  token.

## CodeAlmanac Local Repo

Must prove:

- CLI parser exposes the agreed public launch commands.
- Old public `ingest` and `garden` are removed or hidden from normal help.
- Local read commands work without local setup when committed wiki markers
  exist.
- Local maintenance requires explicit local setup or trigger enablement.
- Local trigger hooks only record events for configured branches.
- Local worker uses the engine contract, not public CLI strings.
- Local run metadata is stored in `~/.codealmanac/control.sqlite`.
- Local run artifacts are stored in `~/.codealmanac/runs/<run-id>/`.
- Auto-update does not replace the current running process.

Current evidence:

- Slice 1 added `src/codealmanac/services/control/` with the launch control
  tables: `repositories`, `branches`, `sessions`, `turns`, `turn_branches`,
  `trigger_events`, `runs`, `run_events`, and `deliveries`.
- `AppConfig.control_db_path` defaults to `~/.codealmanac/control.sqlite`.
- `tests/test_control_service.py` proves the control DB path, schema creation,
  launch vocabulary constraints, and separation from the per-repo query DB.
- `tests/test_architecture.py` now checks that the control schema, store, and
  service facade stay split.

Commands:

```bash
uv run pytest
git diff --check
```

## CodeAlmanac Hosted Repo

Must prove:

- Repo rename is reflected in package names, deployment config, and visible UI.
- Browser onboarding covers auth, GitHub App, repo selection, trigger policy,
  delivery mode, and capture consent.
- Per-branch trigger policy includes delivery mode.
- Cloud worker uses the engine contract, not public CLI strings.
- GitHub delivery checks expected HEAD before writing.
- Dashboard pages are backed by explicit API endpoints or GitHub-owned URLs.

Commands:

```bash
make test
make lint
make smoke-backend
make smoke-modal
```

## Provider / Deployment

Must prove:

- Render service points at `codealmanac-hosted`.
- Vercel project points at the renamed repo and `frontend/` root.
- Modal app name no longer uses `usealmanac`.
- Supabase migrations include the shared control tables, cloud-only product
  tables, `run_events`, `deliveries`, and storage refs.
- GitHub App callback/webhook URLs point at the launch domain.
- Doppler, PostHog, and Autumn visible names are consistent with CodeAlmanac.
