# Launch Progress

Status: active.
Updated: 2026-07-03.

This file tracks the rough percentage estimates used in RelayForge updates.
Percentages are planning estimates, not accounting metrics.

## Latest RelayForge Update

Sent: 2026-07-03 after Slice 82 CodeAlmanac wiki package boundary.

Route:

```bash
doppler run --project almanac --config dev -- \
  relayforge reply \
  --config /Users/rohan/Desktop/Projects/relayforge/relay.config.json \
  --binding rohan-almanac-main "..."
```

Slice 82 moved the repo-wiki/read-model surface into `src/codealmanac/wiki/`,
removed tracked old wiki/read-model service source modules, and kept CLI
behavior unchanged. Full local verification passed with
`uv run ruff check src tests`, `uv run pytest -q --tb=short` (`510 passed`),
and `git diff --check`.

## Latest Local Notes

2026-07-03 provider correction:

- Vercel production was re-linked to project `thealmanac/codealmanac-hosted`
  and redeployed. `https://www.codealmanac.com` now serves deployment
  `dpl_BNAWQDiWydrtXUXfM1D4f61FiwCB`.
- Hosted Modal app `codealmanac-hosted-updates` was redeployed with the current
  `codealmanac` git SHA. Modal image logs showed `codealmanac 0.1.9`.
- Architecture cleanup notes now live under
  `docs/refactor-audit-2026-07-03-hosted-local-architecture/`.
- Slice 81 implemented the first CodeAlmanac-side refactor from that audit:
  `services/cloud_* + workflows/cloud_* -> cloud/`.
- Slice 82 implemented the next CodeAlmanac-side refactor from that audit:
  wiki files, workspaces, index, search, pages, topics, health, and viewer now
  live under `src/codealmanac/wiki/`.

## Percentages

| Area | Latest | Previous | Basis |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CodeAlmanac backend/local | 99% | 98% | Slice 82 moved the repo-wiki/read-model surface into `src/codealmanac/wiki/`, added architecture guards, and passed full local gates. |
| CodeAlmanac CLI/public UX | 100% | 100% | Published CLI `0.1.9` passed public install smoke; root uninstall is now scoped to setup-owned artifacts, while automation teardown remains explicit. |
| CodeAlmanac-hosted backend/auth/API | 100% | 100% | Slice 75 added production `/v1/repositories`; production repo list and repo status pass without per-repo permission fanout. |
| Hosted frontend/onboarding | 100% | 99% | Slice 76 shipped repository readiness, capture handoff, maintained branches, and per-branch delivery to Vercel; Chrome verified production with no console errors. |
| Infra/deploy rename | 100% | 99% | Vercel now targets `thealmanac/codealmanac-hosted`, Render health is live, and Modal `codealmanac-hosted-updates` was redeployed with current `codealmanac` `0.1.9` engine logs. |

## Update Rule

After each verified slice:

1. Move the old `Latest` values into `Previous`.
2. Set new `Latest` values.
3. Send the same values through RelayForge.
4. Record command success or failure in the worklog.
